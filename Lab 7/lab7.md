## 4. Cost Optimization Strategy

Recommendations for reducing costs by leveraging Azure’s features and best practices:

1. **Reserved Instances**:
   - Use reserved instances for predictable workloads (e.g., SQL Database and primary web VMs). Opting for a 3-year reserved instance saves up to 40%.

2. **Auto-Scaling and Right-Sizing**:
   - Enable auto-scaling for the API back-end and web front-end services to manage peak and off-peak periods, minimizing costs by allocating resources only when needed.

3. **Azure Hybrid Benefit**:
   - Use the Azure Hybrid Benefit to reuse existing Windows Server and SQL Server licenses, reducing licensing costs.

4. **Spot VMs for ML Workloads**:
   - Use Spot VMs for ML model training, as they’re ideal for non-critical workloads and are available at significant discounts.

5. **Storage Tiering**:
   - Implement lifecycle management for Blob Storage to move infrequently accessed data to Cool or Archive tiers, saving on storage costs.

## 5. Future Growth and Budget Plan (3-Year Projection)

Projected costs over three years to accommodate business growth and suggested adjustments to optimize future costs.

| Year | Description                          | Cost Increase (%) | Projected Annual Cost |
|------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Year 1** | Migration completion with base operational costs. Apply reserved instances. | 0% (Base Cost)      | ~$500,000             |
| **Year 2** | 15% growth in storage and compute resources for expanded user base. | 15%                 | ~$575,000             |
| **Year 3** | Additional 10% for further growth, switching to serverless where feasible. | 10%                 | ~$632,500             |

### Strategies for Future Optimization:
- **Serverless Transition**: For non-persistent workloads, transition API services to serverless options like Azure Functions to scale costs effectively with demand.
- **Leverage New VM Types**: Azure frequently updates its VM offerings. Switching to more cost-effective VM types can reduce costs without compromising performance.
- **Data Optimization**: Regularly review and archive or delete outdated data to minimize storage costs. Use analytics to understand data usage patterns and adjust storage accordingly.
