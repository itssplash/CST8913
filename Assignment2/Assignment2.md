## Application Deployment
### Task: Deploy a “Hello World” web application on the Windows Server  
**Objective:** Test basic server and network functionality.  
**Steps Taken:**  
1. Installed .NET on the Windows Server.  
2. Created a new ASP.NET Core application:  
   ```bash
   dotnet new web -o HelloWorldApp
   cd HelloWorldApp
   ```
3.Built and ran the application:

  ```bash
  dotnet build
  dotnet run
  ```
4. Verified access to the application at `http://localhost/5022` within the VM network.  

**Outcome:**  
The application was accessible at `http://localhost/5022` within the VM network.

## Migration Assessment
### Task: Use Azure Migrate to perform an assessment of the VM for migration readiness  
**Objective:** Evaluate the VM’s compatibility with Azure and note any necessary adjustments.  
**Steps Taken:**  
1. Created a migration project named "HelloWorldMigration".  
2. Installed the Azure Installer on the VM.  
3. Used PowerShell to run the three scripts required for Azure Migrate on the VM.  

**Challenges Encountered:**  
- **Error 2147942405: Access Denied** while setting up prerequisites for Azure Migrate.  
  - **Resolution:** Resolved the issue by following instructions from [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/514610/azure-migrate-discovery-and-assessment-error-21479). Logged in with my College ID, then proceeded with the migration steps.  
4. Completed the discovery and assessment phases.  
5. Built the business case and assessment report. I have attached the Excel file for both the business case and the assessment report in the outcome.

**Outcome:**  
A migration readiness assessment report was successfully generated, and the migration project was prepared.

## VM Migration Execution  
### Task: Migrate the VM to Azure using Azure Migrate tools  
**Objective:** Complete the VM migration to Azure.  

**Steps Taken:**  
1. Created a new replication VM on VMware Workstation to serve as the replication server.  
   - Allocated resources similar to the primary VM.  
2. Installed the Azure Site Recovery (ASR) replication application software on the replication VM to facilitate the migration process.  
   - Configured the replication VM with the necessary credentials and settings to connect with Azure.  
3. Set up the migration project in Azure named **"HelloWorldMigration"** to track progress.  
4. Used the Azure Migrate tool to replicate the primary VM to Azure:  
   - Configured replication settings, including the source VM and target Azure VM parameters.  
   - Created an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and a Network Security Group (NSG) for the replicated server to ensure secure connectivity.  
5. Resolved challenges encountered during the process:  
   - Faced issues while installing the Mobility Agent on the VM but resolved them using community resources like Stack Overflow and documentation from Microsoft.  
   - The replication process took approximately two hours to complete.  

**Outcome:**  
The VM was successfully replicated and migrated to Azure. Post-migration testing confirmed the functionality of the VM, including access to the **Hello World** application, which was accessible via the Azure-assigned public IP address.

## Validation and Failover Testing
### Task: Validate the migrated VM's functionality and conduct a failover test  
**Objective:** Ensure the application runs as expected post-migration and test failover mechanisms.  
**Steps Taken:**  
1. Accessed the “Hello World” application on the Azure VM via a web browser.  
2. Simulated a failover by shutting down the primary VM and testing availability.  

**Outcome:**  
The application was functional in Azure, and failover mechanisms were validated successfully.

## Reflection  

### Challenges Encountered:  
1. **Azure Migrate Setup:**  
   - Faced the error `Azure Migrate: Discovery and Assessment - Error 2147942405: Access Denied` while setting up the prerequisites.  
   - Resolution: Researched the issue on Microsoft Documentation and resolved it by following the steps provided [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/514610/azure-migrate-discovery-and-assessment-error-21479).  
2. **Mobility Agent Installation:**  
   - Encountered difficulties installing the Mobility Agent on the VM.  
   - Resolution: Referenced solutions from Stack Overflow and other technical forums, which helped successfully complete the installation.  
3. **Replication Duration:**  
   - The replication process took nearly two hours, requiring patience and monitoring.  
4. **Networking and Accessibility:**  
   - Initially, the application was not accessible post-migration due to Network Security Group (NSG) rules in Azure.  
   - Resolution: Updated the NSG to allow HTTP traffic, ensuring the application was accessible.  

### Insights Gained:  
1. **Pre-migration Preparation is Crucial:**  
   The discovery and assessment phase highlighted the importance of resolving potential compatibility and configuration issues before initiating the migration.  

2. **Documentation Saves Time:**  
   Having detailed instructions from official sources (e.g., Microsoft Docs) and community-driven solutions helped troubleshoot challenges effectively.  

3. **Azure Tools Simplify Migration:**  
   Azure Migrate, combined with replication software, provided an intuitive way to transition on-premises VMs to the cloud with minimal downtime.  

4. **Post-Migration Validation is Essential:**  
   Verifying application functionality and resolving accessibility issues post-migration ensured the application's reliability and readiness for use in Azure.  

5. **Learning from Challenges:**  
   The experience of troubleshooting errors like Mobility Agent installation and NSG configuration reinforced problem-solving and resourcefulness, skills critical in cloud migration projects.
