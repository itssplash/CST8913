# Cloud Migration Lab

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to provide a conceptual understanding of cloud migration strategies. It helps to analyze and architect solutions that transition from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud by exploring various service models (PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS). 


## Lab Overview
This lab consists of the following sections:

1. **On-Premises Solution Design**:
   - Understand the architecture of a traditional on-premises solution and identify the key components to migrate to the cloud.
   
2. **Migration Strategies**:
   - Propose strategies for migrating each component to the cloud using PaaS, IaaS, or SaaS services. Evaluate cloud services for web apps, databases, file storage, networking, and email services.

3. **Final Report and Diagrams**:
   - Document the on-premises solution and cloud migration strategies in a detailed report, accompanied by architecture diagrams.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand the difference between on-premises infrastructure and cloud-based solutions.
- Identify which components of a system are best suited for PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS.
- Develop migration strategies that include cloud-native services, scalability, and security.
- Present findings and migration plans in a clear and structured manner using Markdown and GitHub for documentation.

## Repository Structure
- **On-Premises Solution Design**: Description and architecture of the on-premises system.
- **Migration Strategies**: Detailed migration plans for each component of the system.
- **Diagrams**: Visual representation of both on-premises and cloud migration architectures.
- **Final Report**: Comprehensive documentation of the entire lab.
