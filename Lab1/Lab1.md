# 1.	What are the company's motivators of migration to the cloud?<br>
•	**Scalability & Performance:** BMO wanted to increase its computing resources to satisfy the growing market requirements such as performing stress tests and building complex models of risks involved. By moving to Azure, it was feasible to start at 35,000 cores a night, and scale up to 80,000 as the need arose, boosting the risk calculations capabilities of the bank drastically.<br>
•	**Cost Optimization:** BMO tried to lower the cost it incurred in its operations. Making use of Azure Spot Virtual Machines as well as the Hybrid Benefit helped the bank in cutting 30% of overall costs when compared to the use of on-premises infrastructure and another cloud provider.<br>
•	**Efficiency & Speed:** The time taken by BMO for risk analysis was reduced by six times with the azure migration as well as consolidating the risk analysis platform. This is very important in carrying out a risk analysis in a timely manner before the markets open and error free figures for reporting and compliance practices are available.<br>
•	**Flexibility & Resilience:** BMO was interested in a cloud solution that offered a possibility for dynamic resource elastic scaling. Azure offered that flexibility and resiliency since there were regulatory concerns not to be dependent on one cloud vendor.<br>
•	**Modernization:** BMO intended to move away from a ‘lift-and-shift’ approach and instead embrace cloud-first transformation which means optimization of assets and utilization of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and supercomputing to enhance their existing risk management platform.<br>

# 2.	What questions will you ask to understand more about the company infrastructure?<br>
•	What services and applications are currently in use in your on-premises environment?<br>
•	What computer usage needs to reach and when is the workload relatively quiet and alternating?<br>
•	What specific standards does your system have to comply with, regarding regulations?<br>
•	What information [data] security policies, protocols and parameters exist for data at rest and data in motion?<br>
•	What data warehouses and storage technologies are in use at present and how elastic can they be?<br>

# 4.	Describe the most likely migration approach that will suit the chosen company.<br>
•	**Lift-and-Shift:** Moving its Market Risk Next Generation (MRNG) Platform to cloud-based infrastructure services with little change to its architectural style was the approach adopted at the start by BMO. This strategy paved the way for the bank to rapidly expand its computing capabilities and benefit in terms of cost.<br>
•	**Incremental Modernization:** After the first cutover, BMO turned to the work intensification of its workloads by improving the efficiency of compute and storage resources, streamlining IT operations, and utilizing the cloud-native features which Azure provides.One can say that this was a process performed in steps – one would modify the infrastructure, say, by running the same jobs again, and then optimize the performance for the bank’s requirements.<br>



# 5. Produce a high level schedule for the migration process<br>

| **Phase**             | **Tasks**                                                        | **Timeline**               |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Phase 1: Assessment**| Check current systems and decide what needs to be moved          | 1 week                     |
| **Phase 2: Planning**  | Create a plan for moving data and services to the cloud          | 1 week                     |
| **Phase 3: Setup**     | Get the cloud environment ready (create accounts, set permissions) | 1 week                   |
| **Phase 4: Migration** | Move the services and data to the cloud                          | 2-3 weeks                  |
| **Phase 5: Testing**   | Test everything to make sure it works as expected                | 1 week                     |
| **Phase 6: Training**  | Teach staff how to use the new cloud system                      | 1 week                     |
| **Phase 7: Go-Live**   | Make the system live for everyone                                | 1 week                     |
| **Phase 8: Post-Go-Live** | Keep an eye on performance and fix any issues                 | Ongoing                    |

# 6.	What are the main decision criteria for the chosen company?
• **Performance & Scalability:** The bank required the ability to scale up the number of compute resources up to 80,000 or enhance the speed of performing the risk calculations which were critical.<br>
• **Cost Efficiency:** 30% operational cost savings because of the use of Azure Spot VMs as well as the Hybrid Benefit made Azure look good financially.<br>
• **Flexibility:** Thanks to cloud-native tools from Azure, BMO was able to process many more jobs simultaneously in a shorter time, and merge with the existing systems without any transforms.<br>
• **Resilience & Compliance:** The ability to remain multi cloud was critical for regulatory purposes since the BMO did not want to be locked to a single cloud provider.<br>
• **Security & Risk Management:** Significant security improvements and an ability to conducting stress tests at the global level in near real time were the rationale for BMO’s Azure adoption.<br>
